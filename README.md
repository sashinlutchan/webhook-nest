# üì¨ Webhook Nest

**Webhook Nest** gives you a unique URL where external systems can send webhooks/callbacks, and you can view the incoming payloads on a live frontend. It‚Äôs built for **near real-time inspection** with **automatic deletion** via DynamoDB TTL.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Capture incoming webhook requests from any system.
- Display payloads on the frontend within seconds.
- Keep storage **ephemeral** with auto-expiry (TTL).



---

## üß© Service Components

**Backend**
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS Lambda
- AWS DynamoDB (TTL enabled)

**Frontend**
- React app **AWS S3**
- Served globally via **AWS CloudFront**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

1. External service posts a webhook to the **API Gateway** endpoint.
2. **Lambda** validates and stores the request in **DynamoDB** with a TTL.
3. The **frontend** (S3 + CloudFront) fetches recent items and renders them **near real-time** (polling).

**Retention:** Items auto-delete after the configured TTL period ( set inside code ).

---

## üîå API Contract (High-Level)

- **GET /api/v1/webhook/health**  
  Lightweight health check for uptime verification. Returns status and timestamp.

- **POST /api/v1/webhook/createwebhook**  
  Creates a new webhook URL. Returns webhook ID and URL for receiving requests.

- **GET /api/v1/webhook/getwebhook/{id}**  
  Retrieves webhook details by ID. Returns webhook configuration and metadata.

- **GET /api/v1/webhook/getwebhook/events/{id}**  
  Returns the most recent webhook events for a specific webhook ID.

- **ANY /api/v1/webhook/updatewebhook/{id}**  
  Accepts all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD) to capture incoming webhook requests. Stores method, headers, and payload for inspection.

> Notes:  
> ‚Ä¢ Webhook requests are stored short-term only with TTL auto-expiry.  
> ‚Ä¢ Request bodies are treated as opaque JSON payloads (no schema enforcement).  
> ‚Ä¢ All headers and request metadata are captured for debugging.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Model (DynamoDB)

### **Primary Table Structure:**
- **Partition key:** `pk` - Either `WEBHOOK#{id}` for webhook definitions or `EVENT#{guid}` for webhook events
- **Sort key:** `sk` - Either `WEBHOOK` for webhook definitions or `WEBHOOK#{id}` for events  
- **TTL attribute:** `expiresAt` (epoch seconds, 1 hour from creation)

### **Global Secondary Index (GSI1) - "LookUp":**
- **GSI1PK:** `EVENT#{webhook_id}` - Groups events by webhook
- **GSI1SK:** `yyyyMMddHH` - Time-based partitioning for efficient queries

### **Webhook Definition Attributes:**
- `url` - The generated webhook URL endpoint
- `createdAt` - Creation timestamp (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss format)

### **Webhook Event Attributes:**
- `method` - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- `headers` - Map of request headers (key-value pairs)
- `data` - Request payload/body as nested JSON object
- `createdAt` - Event timestamp (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss format)

**Behavior:**  
- Items auto-expire after 1 hour based on `expiresAt` TTL ( Configurable In Code ).  
- Webhook events are queried via GSI1 using webhook ID and current date.  
- Events are grouped by webhook ID for efficient retrieval.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Behavior

- Hosted as static assets in **S3**, served via **CloudFront**.  
- Periodically polls the **GET /events** endpoint (e.g., every few seconds).  
- Displays for each event: method, path, headers, body, received timestamp.  
- Presents a limited recent window only (aligned with ephemeral retention).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (High-Level)

**Backend (Lambda)**
- Table name for events storage
- TTL duration (in seconds)
- Lambdas for backend code
- ApiGateway fir serving Api endpoints


**Frontend**
- API base URL (the API Gateway URL) used for polling

---

## üîê Security & Limits

- **IAM least privilege** for Lambda access to DynamoDB.  
- **Rate limiting / payload size** governed by API Gateway configuration.  
- **No secrets persisted** in event payloads (treat incoming data as untrusted).  
- **Logging** limited to operational needs, avoid logging sensitive payloads.

---

## üöÄ Deployment (Overview)

1. Provision **DynamoDB** table and enable **TTL** on the `expiresAt` attribute.  
2. Deploy **Lambda** and connect it to **API Gateway** routes (`/api/v1/webhook/createwebhook`, `/api/v1/webhook/getwebhook/{id}`, `/api/v1/webhook/getwebhook/events/{id}`, `/api/v1/webhook/updatewebhook/{id}`, `/api/v1/webhook/health`).  
3. Configure **CORS** on API Gateway to allow the CloudFront origin.  
4. Build the **React** frontend, upload to **S3**, and front it with **CloudFront**.  
5. Point the frontend at the API base URL.  
6. Test: send a webhook to `/api/v1/webhook/updatewebhook/{id}` and verify it appears on the UI within seconds.

---

## ‚úÖ Operational Notes

- **Near real-time** is achieved via short-interval polling from the frontend.  
- **Data lifecycle** is controlled entirely by DynamoDB TTL.  
- **Scaling** is serverless: API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB + CloudFront adjust to load.  
- **Observability**: use CloudWatch metrics/logs and DynamoDB metrics for health checks.

## üß™ Testing with cURL

Use these example requests to test your webhook endpoints:
